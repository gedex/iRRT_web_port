iRRT web port
=============

> iRRT is a simple java program for simulating the widely used robotics path planning algorithm known as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree or RRT.

This is my attempt to port iRRT (written in Java) into a single static HTML web application (using Backbone and Processing.js).
